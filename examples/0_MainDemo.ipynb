    "Welcome!  This notebook demonstrates the core features of AutoMPC.\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoMPC is designed to simplify the process of creating a controller for a robot system with unknown dynamics.\n",
    "A standard approach to solving this problem is 1) use a System ID algorithm to produce a model of the system dynamics\n",
    "from data, 2) design an objective which captures the task you want to solve, 3) use an optimization algorithm to solve for a control sequence with respect  to the model and objective function.  AutoMPC provides a toolbox of algorithms for  all three steps, and automates the process of hyperparameter selection for each component.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will use the cart-pole swing-up task as an example.  Although we know the ground truth dynamics for the cart-pole system, we will demonstrate how to work with an unknown dynamical system by using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to learn the dynamics from data.  We will design our model predictive controller using a standard quadratic objective function and an iterative LQR optimizer."
